Night Mess MVP Website Prompt
Essence of Blinkit and Swiggy in Night Mess
Night Mess is an on-campus and off-campus late-night food delivery service aimed at students and locals, offering warm, affordable, and hygienic meals with a student-first mindset. The idea is inspired by the rapid delivery convenience of Blinkit and the food diversity and reliability of Swiggy, but fine-tuned for the student demographic and late-night hunger needs.

Blinkit (formerly Grofers) is known for delivering groceries and essentials within minutes through dark store infrastructure. Swiggy is India’s leading food delivery app offering a wide variety of restaurants, live tracking, and offers. Night Mess draws inspiration from:
- Blinkit's hyperlocal fast delivery model
- Swiggy’s diverse food catalog and reliable experience
- A community-centric approach (student-managed kitchens, affordable meals, personalized recommendations)
